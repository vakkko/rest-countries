# 🌍 Rest Countries

This is my personal project built as part of the **Frontend Mentor** challenge. The goal was to create a web page that displays country flags, where you can **search for a country** and **view important details about each one**. This project showcases my skills in building clean, reusable, and responsive web interfaces using React and modern development tools.
